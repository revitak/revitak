### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I specialize in writing code for Autodesk Revit in C#.  Previous to Revit, I did a bunch of coding for Autodesk AutoCAD.  I am an electrical designer and have extensive knowledge about Revit MEP electrical coding and operations.

Feel free to reach out to me if you need help with anything related to Revit (electrical).
